# tensorflow-CNN-mnist

## Abstract

    It's fast and convenient for me to create Convolutional Neural Networks to classify digital of mnist and analysis result by tensorboard. This paper I will talk about how to use tensorflow and tensorboard.

## key words

    tensorflow    tensorboard    mnist   Convolutional Neural Networks

## related work

1. Learning Basic TensorFlow Grammar
2. Learn to use tensorboard to visualize result and process

## method

1. structured a basic CNN Model

    Follow the tutorial of tensorflow. I struct this model with two convolution layer, a fully connected layer and an output layer. Each convolution layer
